  {
    question: 'Is HIFU treatment painful?',
    answer: 'Most patients describe HIFU as comfortable with occasional mild discomfort. You may feel warmth and tingling as the ultrasound energy is delivered. Any discomfort is temporary and subsides immediately after treatment. No anaesthetic is required.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do HIFU results last?',
    answer: 'HIFU results typically last 1-2 years, with some patients enjoying benefits for longer. Results continue to improve for 2-3 months after treatment as collagen production increases. Maintenance treatments can extend your results.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there any downtime?',
    answer: 'One of the biggest advantages of HIFU is zero downtime! You can return to normal activities immediately. Some patients experience mild redness or slight swelling, but this typically resolves within a few hours.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How many treatments will I need?',
    answer: 'Most patients see excellent results from a single HIFU treatment. For more significant lifting or older skin, a second treatment after 6-12 months may be recommended. We\'ll advise on the best plan during your consultation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Who is an ideal candidate for HIFU?',
    answer: 'HIFU is ideal for anyone with mild to moderate skin laxity - sagging jowls, drooping brows, loose neck skin, or early signs of ageing. It\'s perfect for those wanting lifting without surgery. We assess suitability during consultation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'When will I see results?',
    answer: 'Some lifting is visible immediately, but the best results develop over 2-3 months as new collagen forms. Your skin will continue to improve and tighten during this time, with peak results around 3 months post-treatment.'
